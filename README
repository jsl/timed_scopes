=== Timed Scopes

Times Scopes is a simple plugin to add some named scopes to your model based on their time columns.

= Usage

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_timed_scopes
end

= What It Does

Calling has_timed_scopes will reflect on the model's columns and add three scopes for each column ending in "_at" or "_on". For example, a model with a published_at column gets "published_after", "published_before", and "published_between".

Post.published_after(1.month.ago)
  # => :conditions => ['posts.published_at > ?', 1.month.ago]
Post.published_before(1.year.ago)
  # => :conditions => ['posts.published_at < ?', 1.year.ago]
Post.published_between(2.months.ago, 1.month.ago)
  # => :conditions => ['posts.published_at > ? AND posts.published_at < ?', 2.months.ago, 1.month.ago]

By default, each timed scope will order the results on that column descending. You can ascend by passing "ASC" as an additional argument.

Post.published_before(1.year.ago, "ASC")
